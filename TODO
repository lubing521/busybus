- Use sendmsg and recvmsg instead of writev and readv in __bbus_prot_sendvmsg
  and __bbus_prot_recvvmsg.
- Ignore SIGPIPE on socket level.
- Add new assertions to the test suite: lower-than, lower-or-equal-to,
  greater-than and greater-or-equal-to.
- Proper bbus_hmap_dump().
- bbus_obj_extrbytes() shouldn't probably take the size argument and instead
  only rely on the array size taken from the object buffer.
- Some other way to store and read byte arrays from object with obj_build and
  obj_parse functions.
- Figure out when to pass the -Wno-psabi flag to GCC - e.g. check for ARCH
  variable on make start-up.
- Make busybus more portable - eg. strerror_r, REG_NOERROR etc.
- Proper clean-up code in bbusd.
- Get rid of the 'packed' attribute from bbus_msg structures.
